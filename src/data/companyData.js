Our vision: Inclusive and Accessible Holidays for All – regardless of an individual's needs or age. 

Claire & George is a Swiss non-profit foundation based Bern. Since its establishment in 2013, Claire & George has been committed to enable holidays to be inclusive and accessible for all – regardless of an individual's needs or age. 

It is often forgotten how difficult it can be to go on holidays as a single person, with family or with friends, due to an illness, an accident, life-changing medical/health condition, or age. 

The Foundation serves as a centre of excellence for 'barrier-free' holidays and as mediator between clients, the hospitality industry and providers of care and support services. 

Since 2018, the Foundation has also been serving as one of the official hotel certification agency for accessibility.

Claire & George collaborates with hotels, tourism partners and local service providers in arranging required accommodations and services such as care, accompanied walks, transport, shower chairs or lifters. Starting in 2019 we have also been offering accompanied day trips and private tours from which not only the affected but also their family or travel companions can benefit. We all need relief not only from work, but also from everyday life. A change of scenery does wonders for mental and physical health.`,
    researchChallenge: `C&G is a swiss travel agency for people with disabilities. They have a website where they list a bunch of swiss hotels with information regarding accessibility, but also offer guided tours. However, while there is some income from that, the foundation gets most money from doing projects that are funded by other NGO's or innovation funds. This means that they live off of innovation projects around accessible tourism.

However, they do very little user research. Most of the project are based in workshops with experts form NGO's and such. They are thus also very unfamiliar with actual user research and integration into the innovation process. They are also currently looking for AI based innovation projects.

Our challenge here is C&G's unfamiliarity with proper user research, and thus skepticism towards is usefulness or unclarity about when to use it.
However, the opportunity lies in the fact that this research could lay the basis for highly relevant innovation projects to further sustain the NGO. The goal of our tool is thus to help C&G identify innovation opportunities that will attract funding.`,
