Interview transcript 1:

Interviewer (I): Hi, I’m Jamie from Claire & George. We’re working to improve how people with disabilities plan trips and would love to learn from your experience. Thanks so much for joining. Before we start, is it okay if I record this conversation and take notes? Everything you share will stay confidential.

Participant (P): Yes, that’s fine. Happy to help.

2. Quick Background (3 min)
I: Great. To start, can you briefly tell me about your disability and what kind of travel accommodations you typically need?

P: Sure. I have muscular dystrophy, so I use a power wheelchair full-time. I also travel with a personal care assistant. I need step-free access everywhere—transport, hotel rooms, bathrooms. I also need a hoist for transfers and preferably an electric bed.

I: Thanks. What was the purpose of your most recent trip?

P: Leisure. I went to Barcelona last summer with a friend. It was a kind of “bucket list” trip—I've always wanted to see the architecture there.

3. Core Booking Journey (6 min)
Trigger & Research (2 min)
I: What first prompted you to start planning that trip?

P: I saw a travel blog post about accessible things to do in Barcelona. I got excited and thought, “Why not?” It was spontaneous but quickly turned into a research marathon.

I: Where did you look for accessibility information?

P: I started on Google, but it was chaotic. I checked blogs, Reddit, TripAdvisor forums, then moved to websites like Handiscover and AccessibleGO. But I had to cross-check everything—there was no single source I could rely on.

Decision & Booking Steps (4 min)
I: Can you walk me through the steps you took to go from researching to confirming a booking?

P: First, I listed places that claimed to be accessible. Then I emailed or called each hotel directly to ask about specifics—door widths, bed height, if the bathroom had grab bars. Many didn’t respond, or gave vague answers like “wheelchair-friendly,” which means nothing.

I: Did any platforms help?

P: Booking.com let me filter for "accessible rooms," but that’s superficial. I still had to call. I ended up choosing a hotel based on a YouTube video tour someone posted—just seeing the actual layout helped me decide.

I: And how did you book?

P: I called the hotel to confirm accessibility, then booked directly through their website. For flights, I used the airline’s accessibility line—still had to explain my equipment twice.

4. Pain Points & Workarounds (5 min)
I: What was the biggest frustration during planning or booking?

P: The lack of consistent, trustworthy accessibility information. Every site uses different terms, and there’s no standard. Even photos often leave out the bathroom—which is the most critical part.

I: Did you create any workarounds or "hacks" to get what you needed?

P: I did. I made a checklist of accessibility needs and pasted it into every email I sent to hotels. Also, I searched for wheelchair travel vlogs on YouTube to get real visuals. I even messaged one vlogger directly to ask where they stayed.

5. Prioritization & Closing (4 min)
Feature Check (2 min)
I: Here are three potential features we’re exploring:

Standardized accessibility ratings for hotels,

An AI-powered chat advisor for planning, and

Virtual tours of accessible rooms.
Which would be most helpful to you, and why?

P: Honestly? The virtual tours. I can tell within seconds if a room works for me just by seeing it. Photos can be misleading. If I had a 360° view or even a walk-through video, I could skip so many calls and emails.

I: Good to know. What about the AI chat advisor?

P: It could help, if it knew the right questions to ask. Like, “Does the shower have a bench?” or “Is there turning space beside the toilet?” But only if it was really trained on accessibility.

Final Thoughts (2 min)
I: Any last suggestions for making accessible-travel booking easier?

P: Centralize the information. Right now it’s scattered across blogs, forums, and hotel sites. If there were a single portal with verified, standardized info and visuals—that’d change the game. Also, include lived experiences. Let disabled travelers rate places from their perspective.

I: That’s incredibly helpful. Thank you so much for your time and openness. We’ll be analyzing themes from interviews like this to design better solutions—and we’ll keep you posted if you'd like to see early concepts.

P: Absolutely, I’d love that. Thanks again.

Interview transcirpt 2:

Interviewer (Alex, UX Researcher at Claire & George):
Hi! I’m Alex from Claire & George. Thank you so much for taking the time today. We’re looking at ways to improve how people with disabilities plan and book trips, and your experience can really help shape the future of more accessible and inclusive travel.

Just to confirm, are you okay with me recording this conversation for note-taking purposes? Everything will remain confidential.

Participant (Sarah, 39, London):
Yes, that’s totally fine. Happy to help.

2. Quick Background (3 min)
Alex:
Great, thanks! To start us off, could you briefly tell me about your disability and the kinds of accommodations you typically need when traveling?

Sarah:
Sure. I have Multiple Sclerosis—it's relapsing-remitting, so my mobility varies, but I usually need a wheelchair for longer distances. I also get fatigued easily, so I need step-free access, ideally a roll-in shower, and proximity to medical services is something I often look for, just in case.

Alex:
Got it, thanks. What was the purpose of your most recent trip?

Sarah:
It was leisure—just a short getaway with my partner to Cornwall last summer. We wanted to relax, do a bit of coastal walking if possible.

3. Core Booking Journey (6 min)
Trigger & Research (2 min)
Alex:
Sounds lovely. So, what first prompted you to start planning that trip?

Sarah:
Honestly, we both just needed a break. I had a tough flare-up in the spring, and by summer I was doing better, so we said, “Let’s get some sea air.”

Alex:
Where did you start looking for information about accessibility?

Sarah:
A mix of places. First I googled “accessible cottages Cornwall.” Then I went on a couple of forums—Scope, and also a Facebook group called ‘Accessible Holidays UK’. I also tried Airbnb, but their filters are kind of misleading. “Wheelchair accessible” can mean a ramp at the door and nothing else.

Decision & Booking Steps (4 min)
Alex:
Could you walk me through the steps you took from finding options to confirming the booking?

Sarah:
Sure. So first, I listed a bunch of properties from Airbnb and a specialist agency—DisabledHolidays.com. Then I started cross-referencing reviews. For every place that claimed to be accessible, I’d dig through reviews or photos to try and figure out, like, “Is there really a walk-in shower?” or “How steep is that ramp?”

I emailed a few property owners directly with questions—about door widths, bed heights, and if local taxis could take a wheelchair. A couple didn’t reply, and one said “we think it should be fine,” which was not reassuring.

Eventually, we booked through the specialist agency. It was via email and phone. They sent over a detailed access sheet and even called the owner to double-check. That personal touch helped a lot.

Alex:
That sounds like a lot of work. Were there any tools or features that really helped—or anything that was clearly missing?

Sarah:
The agency’s “access statement” PDF was helpful, even though it wasn’t interactive. But across the board, I wish more places had virtual walk-throughs or even just a floor plan with measurements. And having to email so many people was exhausting—if there was a way to just talk to a smart advisor and ask, “Can I get my chair into the bathroom here?” that would be gold.

4. Pain Points & Workarounds (5 min)
Alex:
What was your biggest frustration during planning or booking?

Sarah:
Uncertainty. That constant second-guessing—“Will this actually work for me?” It feels like I’m solving a puzzle without all the pieces. Also, lack of consistency in how places describe accessibility. Everyone uses different language—some say “fully accessible,” others say “mobility-friendly,” and neither means much unless you really dig.

Alex:
Did you come up with any personal “hacks” or workarounds to get the info you needed?

Sarah:
Yes, one thing I do is zoom in on photos and look for clues. Like, if there’s a bathroom photo, I’ll check if there’s space beside the toilet or if the sink is pedestal-style. Also, I sometimes find videos of the property on YouTube or ask in my Facebook group if anyone’s been there before.

Oh! And I now save a template email with all my access questions—I just copy and paste it to different hosts. Saves me time.

5. Prioritization & Closing (4 min)
Feature Check (2 min)
Alex:
That’s really clever. I want to share three possible features we’re considering and get your take on which would help you most:

A standardized accessibility rating system for properties

An AI chat assistant to answer access-related questions in real-time

Virtual room tours of accommodations

Which one stands out for you and why?

Sarah:
Oof, tough choice. I’d say the AI assistant, actually. Ratings are great, but they still rely on someone else’s idea of what matters. I want to ask my questions—like, “Is there space to transfer on the left side of the bed?”—and get tailored answers.

That said, virtual tours would be a close second. Nothing beats seeing it with your own eyes.

Final Thoughts (2 min)
Alex:
Thank you, that’s super helpful. Any final suggestions for how we could make booking more accessible?

Sarah:
Yeah—maybe create “personas” or profiles for different access needs. So when I search, I can say “I use a manual wheelchair, can transfer, need roll-in shower, and can’t do steps,” and then get filtered results. Right now, I feel like I’m reinventing the wheel every time I search.

And just generally: transparency over perfection. I don’t mind if something isn’t perfect—I just want to know exactly what I’m walking—or wheeling—into.

Alex:
That’s a fantastic point. Thank you again, Sarah. We really appreciate your time and thoughtful answers. We’re using these insights to guide our service and product design—this will make a real difference.

Sarah:
I’m glad! I really hope it helps make travel less of a battle for others.

Interview transcript 3:

Participant: Jane M.
Interviewer: Alex R. (UX Researcher at Claire & George)
Date: April 10, 2025
Duration: 20 minutes
Format: Zoom call
Consent: Recording and note-taking confirmed.

1. Welcome & Context (2 min)
Alex (Interviewer):
Hi Jane, thanks so much for joining us today. I’m Alex from Claire & George. We’re exploring ways to improve how people with disabilities plan and book holidays, so your experiences will really help shape some upcoming services. This chat will take about 20 minutes.

Is it okay if I record and take notes during our session? Everything is confidential and only used for research.

Jane (Participant):
Yes, that’s totally fine.

Alex:
Great, thank you!

2. Quick Background (3 min)
Alex:
To start, could you briefly tell me about your disability and the kind of accommodations you usually look for when traveling?

Jane:
Sure. I have multiple sclerosis, and I use a power wheelchair full-time. So I need step-free access, roll-in showers, wide doorways—those basics. But I also look for things like ceiling hoists if I’m traveling alone or with my carer, and ideally adjustable beds. Not all of those are easy to find.

Alex:
Thanks. And what was the purpose of your most recent trip?

Jane:
It was a leisure trip—to Cornwall last summer. A sort of “recharge” holiday after a rough winter. I went with a close friend who’s also my support person.

3. Core Booking Journey (6 min)
Trigger & Research (2 min)
Alex:
What prompted you to start planning that trip?

Jane:
Honestly? Burnout. I needed a mental break. I saw a photo on Instagram of someone in a beach wheelchair in Cornwall, and that sparked the idea. I thought, “If they managed it, maybe I can too.”

Alex:
Where did you look for info on accessibility?

Jane:
First I Googled “accessible cottages Cornwall,” but the results were really mixed. Then I found a few Facebook groups—those were gold. Other wheelchair users were sharing specific places they’d stayed. I also checked sites like AccessAble and Euan’s Guide, but they didn’t always have the specific places I was considering.

Decision & Booking Steps (4 min)
Alex:
Can you walk me through the key steps from researching to actually booking?

Jane:
Sure. So first I found a shortlist of places that claimed to be accessible. Then I had to go deep—like emailing or calling each one to confirm specifics. For example, one said “wheelchair accessible” but meant just a ramp at the entrance—nothing else.

I actually created a spreadsheet with pros and cons, because there were so many variables: bathroom layout, bed height, hoist availability, even if the local town had accessible restaurants.

Eventually, I narrowed it down to two, but had to call both. One never picked up. The other had a manager who really understood accessible travel. She sent photos of the bathroom, even took a quick video walkthrough, and helped arrange a beach wheelchair rental through a local charity. That’s the one I booked—over the phone, not online.

Alex:
So would you say phone was essential?

Jane:
Absolutely. The website just didn’t give enough detail. I couldn’t risk it based on vague icons or generic language.

4. Pain Points & Workarounds (5 min)
Alex:
What was your biggest frustration during planning or booking?

Jane:
The lack of standardization. “Accessible” means so many different things. Some sites showed a wheelchair icon, but didn’t explain what that meant. Also, so many places didn’t respond to emails or had outdated accessibility info.

Alex:
Did you come up with any hacks or alternative ways to get the info you needed?

Jane:
Yes! I started using Google Street View to check out entrances of buildings. Also, I posted in disability travel forums asking if anyone had stayed in the places I was considering. That peer validation helped more than anything official. And I always asked for real photos—not just the polished ones.

5. Prioritization & Closing (4 min)
Feature Check (2 min)
Alex:
Let me give you three potential improvements. Which would help you most, and why?

Standardized accessibility ratings across all listings.

An AI-powered chat assistant for answering accessibility questions.

Virtual tours that let you explore accommodations in detail.

Jane:
That’s hard… I want all three. But if I had to choose, I’d go with virtual tours. Being able to see exactly what I’m dealing with—the shower setup, the space around the bed—would reduce so much anxiety. AI chat sounds great too, but only if it has accurate info.

Final Thoughts (2 min)
Alex:
Any last thoughts or ideas for how to make booking easier for travelers with disabilities?

Jane:
Yes—have actual disabled people test the places. A badge that says “wheelchair user verified” would mean the world. Also, filters should be more detailed—like “has hoist,” “electric bed,” “carer accommodation,” not just “accessible.”

Alex:
That’s a great point. Thanks so much, Jane. This has been incredibly helpful. We’re working on some tools to improve this space, and your feedback will really guide our next steps.

Jane:
I’m glad! Thanks for listening—most people don’t.
