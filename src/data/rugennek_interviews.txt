Interview transcript 1:

Interviewer (I): Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with us today, Laura. We're working on improving the experience across all our clinics and would really value your honest thoughts — both good and bad.

Laura (P): No problem at all. Happy to help!

I: Before we begin, your answers will stay anonymous and will only be used to improve our services. Is it okay if I take some notes and record this call for accuracy?

P: Yes, that’s totally fine.

1. Background & Context (3 min)
I: To start, can you tell me what brought you to our clinic?

P: Sure. I’ve been struggling with neck pain for almost a year. I work long hours at a desk, and over time it just got worse. My physiotherapist suggested I try chiropractic care, so I looked for something nearby.

I: And which location are you being treated at?

P: The Den Haag clinic.

I: Great. Was this your first experience with our clinic?

P: Yes, first time. I had seen the name before but never visited.

2. The Treatment Journey (8 min)
A. Intake to First Visit
I: How did you experience the intake and scheduling process?

P: It was honestly one of the smoothest I’ve ever had. I filled in the form online and got a call within a day to schedule. The receptionist was friendly, asked some helpful questions, and gave me clear instructions.

I: That’s good to hear. Any issues with waiting time or clarity?

P: Not really — I think I waited four days for my first appointment, which felt reasonable. The confirmation email was very clear, with directions and what to expect.

I: And what were your first impressions when you arrived?

P: Very positive. The space felt calm and professional, and everyone greeted me warmly. I noticed right away that it didn’t feel like a rushed or chaotic place — which made a difference because I was a bit anxious.

B. During Treatment
I: How has the treatment process been for you so far?

P: Really good. My chiropractor, Dr. van Dijk, explained everything in detail, especially during the first session. He showed me diagrams and even pointed out on a model what was happening with my spine.

I: Did that help you feel more comfortable?

P: Definitely. I appreciated that he didn’t just jump into cracking my neck — we had a whole conversation first. Each session feels personalized. Sometimes he adapts the treatment based on how I say I’m feeling that day, which I didn’t expect.

I: Do you feel that the treatment aligns with what you expected or hoped for?

P: Yes — and actually, it exceeded my expectations. I thought it would just be adjustments, but there’s also posture advice and stretching tips. I’m already noticing improvement.

C. Aftercare & Follow-Up
I: Have you had any follow-ups or aftercare so far?

P: Yes, we’ve scheduled all 10 sessions up front, and every week we do a quick check-in. After the third session, they emailed me some exercises with videos, which I liked.

I: Did you feel clear on the next steps?

P: Yes, although I would’ve liked a clearer sense of the “end goal” — like what kind of improvement to expect by week 10.

3. Emotional Experience & Key Moments (5 min)
I: Can you tell me about a moment that stood out to you — good or bad?

P: Hmm... yes, actually. During my second visit, I mentioned I had a really rough night of sleep and was emotionally drained. Dr. van Dijk didn’t brush it off — he adjusted the session to be gentler and checked in twice to see how I was doing. That felt really human.

I: Why was that moment memorable?

P: It wasn’t just about the physical treatment — I felt genuinely cared for. Like I wasn’t just Patient #12 that day.

I: Did you feel heard and understood during your treatment?

P: Very much so. I’ve never felt rushed, and they remember details about my situation.

I: What part of the experience made you feel most confident or cared for?

P: The consistency. The receptionist knows my name, my chiropractor follows up on previous issues, and even the email reminders are friendly but professional. It makes me feel like I’m in good hands.

I: Was there anything that felt confusing, frustrating, or unnecessary?

P: The only thing that comes to mind is the initial intake form — I had to fill it in online and again on paper when I arrived. That felt redundant. Maybe digitize that fully?

4. Final Reflections & Suggestions (2 min)
I: What could we do to make the experience better for you or others like you?

P: Hmm… I’d say more guidance on the treatment timeline — like setting expectations early on. Maybe a short printed roadmap that shows what to expect week by week?

I: That’s a great idea. Would you recommend the clinic to a friend or family member?

P: Absolutely. I already told my sister to check it out. I think it’s the mix of professionalism and genuine care that makes it stand out.

✅ Wrap-Up
I: That’s really valuable feedback, Laura. Thanks again for sharing all this — it gives us clear insight into what’s working and where we can improve.

P: You’re very welcome. I’m glad you’re taking time to ask patients — it shows you care.

I: We’re collecting input like this from different patients to identify patterns and make the experience even better and more consistent across clinics. Thanks again and best of luck with the rest of your treatment!

P: Thanks! Take care.


Interview transcript 2:

Interviewer (I): Thanks for taking the time to speak with us. We’re working on improving the experience at our clinics and would love to hear your honest thoughts.

Participant (P): Sure! Happy to help — I actually love giving feedback when it might help someone else.

I: Great to hear. Just a quick heads-up: your answers will stay anonymous and will only be used to improve our services. Is it okay if I take notes or record for accuracy?

P: Yeah, that’s totally fine.

2. Background & Context
I: Can you tell me what brought you to our clinic — was it neck pain, a sport injury, something else?

P: It was actually lower back pain that started from sitting too long — I’m a remote software developer, so I’m at a desk 10+ hours a day. It got to a point where I couldn’t sleep well anymore.

I: That sounds tough. Which location are you being treated at?

P: The one in Utrecht — the one near the canal. I live just a bike ride away.

I: Got it. And was this your first experience with our clinic, or have you been here before?

P: First time. I’d never done anything chiropractic before. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical going in.

3. The Treatment Journey
A. Intake to First Visit
I: How did you experience the intake and scheduling process?

P: Surprisingly smooth. I used the website — I liked that I could see the available times directly and book without calling. But I did get confused about whether the intake was a full treatment or just a consult. That wasn’t super clear.

I: Interesting. What were your first impressions when you visited the clinic?

P: Honestly, I was impressed. The place didn’t feel clinical or cold. More like a wellness studio. The receptionist offered me tea — small thing, but it immediately lowered my guard. It felt human.

B. During Treatment
I: How has the treatment process been for you so far?

P: Really good. My chiropractor — Lotte — she’s incredible. She explained what was happening with my posture in a way that made sense. Like, visually showing me diagrams, not just talking.

I: Did the treatment align with what you expected or hoped for?

P: More than. I expected some bone-cracking and vague promises. But she gave me a clear 6-week plan, exercises to do at home, and even warned me about possible soreness after the first few sessions. I felt in control, not just “treated.”

C. Aftercare & Follow-Up
I: Have you had follow-up sessions or aftercare yet? If so, how did that go?

P: Yep, I’ve done five sessions so far. The reminder texts are helpful, and after the third session, I got an email with updated advice and a quick survey. That made me feel like they were tracking my progress, not just scheduling appointments.

4. Emotional Experience & Key Moments
I: Can you tell me about a moment that stood out to you — in a good or bad way?

P: Oh, yes. There was this one moment where I was late by 10 minutes — totally my fault — and I expected a cold “you missed your slot” reaction. But instead, they adjusted another patient and fit me in. They didn’t make me feel like a burden. That kind of flexibility is rare.

I: Why was that moment memorable?

P: It made me feel like I mattered more than their schedule. That’s rare in healthcare.

I: Did you feel heard and understood during your treatment?

P: Yes — actually, more than with my GP. They asked questions I hadn’t even considered relevant, like how I sleep and what my workspace looks like. I felt like they looked at me not just the pain.

I: What part of the experience made you feel most confident or cared for?

P: The custom plan. I’ve been to physios before where it felt cookie-cutter. Here, the exercises were tweaked after each session based on how I was doing. It made me feel like I was part of the process, not just a passive body.

I: Was there anything that felt confusing, frustrating, or unnecessary?

P: Just the intake ambiguity I mentioned — I didn’t know if it included treatment or not. And the invoice emails were a bit plain — no breakdown or summary of what I’d had done. That would help for insurance claims.

5. Final Reflections & Suggestions
I: What could we do to make the entire experience better for you or others like you?

P: Hmm. Maybe a short video that explains what to expect during the intake. Something on the website or in the confirmation email. Also, a progress tracker in the app — like “Session 3 of 6” with notes — would be amazing.

I: Would you recommend the clinic to a friend or family member? Why or why not?

P: Absolutely, and I already have. My sister started going last month. The vibe is welcoming, the care is personal, and the pain is actually improving. It’s not just hype.

I: That’s amazing to hear. Thank you so much for all this input — super helpful. We’re collecting feedback like this from different patients to find patterns and improve the overall experience. You’ve given us a lot to think about.

P: Glad to help. And thanks for asking — this kind of feedback loop is rare in healthcare.


Interview transcript 3:

1. Welcome & Context (2 min)
Interviewer:
Thanks for taking the time to speak with us. We’re working on improving the experience at our clinics and would love to hear your honest thoughts.

Marloes:
Happy to help. I think it’s great you’re doing this.

Interviewer:
Your answers will stay anonymous and will only be used to improve our services. Is it okay if I take notes or record for accuracy?

Marloes:
Yes, no problem.

2. Background & Context (3 min)
Interviewer:
Can you tell me what brought you to our clinic — was it neck pain, a sport injury, something else?

Marloes:
I’ve had chronic neck and upper back pain for years — mostly from working at a computer all day. It was starting to affect my sleep and mood, so I finally decided to do something about it.

Interviewer:
At which location are you being treated?

Marloes:
The Utrecht location.

Interviewer:
Was this your first experience with our clinic, or have you been here before?

Marloes:
First time, though I’d seen some ads and had a colleague who recommended it.

3. The Treatment Journey (8 min)
A. Intake to First Visit (3 min)
Interviewer:
How did you experience the intake and scheduling process?

Marloes:
The online booking was smooth, but I wasn’t totally sure what kind of appointment I was booking. I chose “intake” but didn’t really know what that would involve. It wasn’t clear if there would be treatment during that first visit or not.

Interviewer:
And the waiting time?

Marloes:
It was pretty quick — I got an appointment within a week, which was nice.

Interviewer:
What were your first impressions when you visited the clinic?

Marloes:
Warm and professional. The receptionist was friendly, and the space felt calm. But I was a bit unsure where to sit or what to do when I arrived — a small sign or “what to expect” message in advance would’ve helped.

B. During Treatment (3 min)
Interviewer:
How has the treatment process been for you so far?

Marloes:
Really good overall. The chiropractor explained things clearly and used visuals to show what was going on with my spine. I liked that it wasn’t just manual adjustments — there were also exercises and advice on posture.

Interviewer:
Did the treatment align with your expectations?

Marloes:
It exceeded them. I had this idea it would just be “cracking bones,” but I learned a lot about the root causes of my pain. That said, I didn’t expect to be asked to come in twice a week for several weeks. I wish that had been explained more upfront.

C. Aftercare & Follow-Up (2 min)
Interviewer:
Have you had follow-up sessions or aftercare yet? If so, how did that go?

Marloes:
Yes, I’ve had several follow-ups. They’ve been good, though sometimes it’s hard to reach someone by phone if I need to reschedule. I would love a patient portal or app where I can manage everything and see notes from past sessions.

4. Emotional Experience & Key Moments (5 min)
Interviewer:
Can you tell me about a moment that stood out to you — in a good or bad way?

Marloes:
Yes — during one session, I mentioned how I was feeling anxious and tired, and the chiropractor actually paused and asked more about that. It turned into a bigger conversation about how my stress might be affecting my body. That felt very human.

Interviewer:
Why was that moment memorable?

Marloes:
Because it wasn’t just about my neck — I felt like they saw me as a whole person, not just a set of symptoms.

Interviewer:
Did you feel heard and understood during your treatment?

Marloes:
Yes, definitely. Though sometimes I wished there was more consistency — I had two different chiropractors, and they had slightly different approaches. A short handover summary would’ve helped me feel more continuity.

Interviewer:
What part of the experience made you feel most confident or cared for?

Marloes:
The fact that they tracked my progress and re-assessed me. It wasn’t just “come forever” — there was a clear plan.

Interviewer:
Was there anything that felt confusing, frustrating, or unnecessary?

Marloes:
Yes — the treatment package and pricing. It was a bit salesy. I didn’t understand why I had to commit to a bundle of 10 sessions right away. It made me question whether it was medically necessary or just business.

5. Final Reflections & Suggestions (2 min)
Interviewer:
What could we do to make the entire experience better for you or others like you?

Marloes:
Be more transparent up front — especially about treatment frequency, costs, and how the process works over time. Also, modernize the communication: an app or at least online rescheduling and treatment tracking would be a game changer.

Interviewer:
Would you recommend the clinic to a friend or family member? Why or why not?

Marloes:
Yes, and I already have. The quality of care is excellent. Just be prepared to ask questions and advocate for what you need.

Wrap-Up

Interviewer:
Thanks so much for your time, Marloes. This is exactly the kind of insight we’re looking for. We’re speaking to several patients like yourself to look for patterns and improve the overall experience. Really appreciate your honesty.

Marloes:
You’re welcome. Happy to help — and good luck with the improvements!
